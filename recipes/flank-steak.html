    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Flank steak is a <em>lean</em> cut of beef that comes from the cow's lower abdominal muscles. It's a relatively tough cut that's low in fat, which means a few things: Flank steak doesn't need to be trimmed, it's inexpensive compared to other cuts, and it benefits greatly from marination.</p>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 Cup Vetable Oil</li>
        <li>1/3 Cup Low-Sodium Soy Sauce</li>

        <li>1/2 Teaspoon Ground Black Pepper</li>
        <li>1 (1 1/2-pound) Flank Steak</li>
